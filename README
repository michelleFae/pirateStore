Version 1.0 10/14/2018.

This directory contains a pirate store inventory system made just for fun :) . Java 8 was used to implement the program.

GENERAL NOTE ON STYLE:      The source code follows conventions of the Java Style checker.
                            This includes the convention of dealing with "magic numbers."
                            According to this convention, constants which are NOT assigned
                            to a variable cannot be used in the code. Hence, every constant
                            number has been assigned to a variable, even though it might
                            appear redundant at times.

GENERAL NOTE ON IMAGES:     All images used in this program are accessed by fetching them
                            directly from the internet. This has been done to ensure
                            transparency as to where I got the images from.

src/sample  (contains source code)

    Cart.java               This class behaves as a shopping cart. It contains the user's
                            choice of items to purchase.

    Main.java               Entry point to program. This also handles the GUI used in the 
                            program.

    Item.java               This class behaves as both an item as well as a shop, for
                            reasons specified in the Javadoc comment for the Class
                            (the program deals with only one shop). Each item
                            can be added to a user's Cart. An item can also deal with
                            aspects pertaining to other items, as it behave like a shop.
